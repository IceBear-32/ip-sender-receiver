For real, this thing does work but not as expected lol, it will work only if the devices are connected to the same network (idk) but would work on same device lol

ok so what you need to do is, compile the `sender.c` file and send the binary to someone (actually this wouldn't work lol it needs a fix) and you run the `receiver.py` file in your pc.<br>
while the `receiver.py` program is running on your pc, if someone opens the sender binary, then the ip should pop up on your `receiver.py` program.
